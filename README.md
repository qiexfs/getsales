# GetSales.io Unbeatable Pricing: Team-Centric LinkedIn Automation, Advanced Safety Features, Multichannel Outreach

Remember the old days when LinkedIn prospecting meant opening a hundred browser tabs, copying messages one by one, and praying your account wouldn't get flagged? Yeah, those were the days. The bad days.

Then came the era of automation tools that promised the world but delivered account bans instead. Fun times.

Enter GetSales.io, and suddenly everything shifted. This isn't your typical "set it and forget it until LinkedIn locks you out" automation tool. This is what happens when people who've actually lived the B2B sales grind for over a decade decide to build something that works.

## What Makes GetSales.io Different (And Why That Actually Matters)

Here's the thing about GetSales.io: it was built by founders who got tired of the manual grind themselves. Eugene and Edgar started this journey six years ago, frustrated that no cloud solution could properly automate LinkedIn outreach without turning your account into a sitting duck for LinkedIn's security algorithms.

What they created is the first genuinely team-centric LinkedIn automation platform. Not "team-friendly" or "team-compatible" — team-centric from the ground up. The difference? You can manage outreach from 50+ LinkedIn profiles and unlimited email inboxes from a single tab. One unified dashboard where everything happens, everyone collaborates, and nothing falls through the cracks.

The platform combines LinkedIn and email automation with what they call Single Session Protection. This exclusive technology lets you run cloud automation while accessing LinkedIn in a single session — basically, your account behaves like you're actually sitting there, clicking away manually, because that's exactly what LinkedIn sees.

## Pricing That Doesn't Make You Want to Cry

Let's talk money, because that's usually where automation tools go from "interesting" to "are you kidding me?"

GetSales.io offers two main pricing structures: Pay per Project and Pay per Sender Flex. The pricing is refreshingly straightforward and, according to multiple user reviews, actually delivers value without the usual software sticker shock.

### Pay per Project Plans

## Features That Actually Solve Real Problems

GetSales.io isn't just throwing features at the wall to see what sticks. Each capability addresses something that's genuinely annoying about sales automation.

**Unified Inbox** means you're not juggling multiple tools, tabs, and login credentials. All your LinkedIn messages and emails land in one place. Your team sees everything. Communication history syncs automatically. It's like having a CRM that doesn't hate you.

**Sender Profile Rotation** is where things get clever. The platform automatically rotates between your LinkedIn and email profiles to maximize conversions while keeping each account safe. Add multiple senders with one click, and the system handles the rotation logic for you.

**Single Session Protection** is the secret sauce for account safety. GetSales uses exclusive technology (powered by GoLogin anti-detect integration) to ensure your LinkedIn automation runs in a single session with residential proxies. To LinkedIn's algorithms, it looks like you're just really efficient at your job, not running automation.

**Account-Based Outreach** lets you target at the account level, not just individual contacts. This means you can coordinate messaging across multiple decision-makers at the same company without accidentally sending the same pitch to everyone.

**GetSales Intelligence** provides smart scheduling and safety layers that adapt to LinkedIn's behavior patterns. The system knows when to slow down, when to speed up, and when to play it cool.

The platform also includes A-Z Testing (not just A/B), a Chrome extension for saving leads directly from LinkedIn, webhook integrations for custom workflows, and a full API for teams that need deeper customization.

## What Real Users Are Actually Saying

User reviews paint a pretty consistent picture. People love the pricing (frequently described as "unbeatable" and "a fraction of competitors"), the safety features, and the responsive customer support.

One agency founder put it this way: "We've tried many software solutions, including Expandi, but GetSales is the clear winner. What sets them apart is the best market safety, stability and price. On top of that continuous improvements and new features."

Another user who switched from LaGrowthMachine noted: "Switching from Waalaxy helped us scale our LinkedIn accounts 5x while significantly reducing our software costs."

The common praise themes: easy to use, stable, cost-efficient, great for agencies, excellent customer support with direct Slack communication, and genuinely safe LinkedIn automation that doesn't get accounts flagged.

The criticisms? Some users mention that data enrichment can be slow with large databases, occasional downtime during updates, and the interface could use some polish. The AI features are still evolving and aren't perfect yet. But compared to competitors, these are relatively minor gripes.

## Who Is This Actually For?

GetSales.io targets three main groups:

**Lead generation agencies** get the most bang for their buck. The platform was literally rebuilt from scratch to serve agencies better. Multiple sender profiles, unified management, whitelabel options, and API access make it perfect for agencies running campaigns for multiple clients.

**IT service companies and B2B tech firms** appreciate the technical sophistication. The Single Session Protection, premium proxies, and enterprise-level support fit teams that understand the technical risks of LinkedIn automation.

**GTM (Go-To-Market) engineers and sales teams** at growing companies find the combination of safety, scalability, and pricing hard to beat. You can start with the Solo plan and scale up as your team grows without switching platforms.

## The Safety Stuff (Because Getting Banned Sucks)

LinkedIn automation is a bit like jaywalking — everyone does it, but you really don't want to get caught. GetSales.io takes the safety angle seriously with multiple layers of protection:

The **Single Session Protection** technology is exclusive to GetSales. It integrates with GoLogin's anti-detect browser to ensure you're accessing LinkedIn in a single, consistent session while running cloud automation. This mimics natural human behavior far better than traditional automation.

**Premium Bright Data proxies** are included in all plans. These are residential IPs that rotate appropriately and look like regular home internet connections to LinkedIn.

**LinkedIn Server Schedule** is another exclusive feature that schedules actions directly on LinkedIn's servers rather than through external automation, making the activity appear even more natural.

The platform also includes smart rate limiting, randomized action timing, and automatic warm-up sequences for new accounts.

## Integration and Workflow

GetSales.io plays nicely with the tools you're probably already using. Native integrations include HubSpot CRM, Pipedrive, Kommo, and more. The webhook system supports 20+ events, so you can trigger actions in other tools based on what happens in GetSales.

The Chrome extension lets you save leads directly from LinkedIn searches, Sales Navigator, or any LinkedIn page with a single click. The data flows straight into your GetSales CRM with automatic enrichment.

For teams with custom needs, the API provides programmatic access to most platform functions. You can build custom integrations, automate campaign creation, or pull analytics into your own dashboards.

## The Bottom Line

GetSales.io delivers on its core promise: safe, scalable LinkedIn and email automation at pricing that doesn't require a board meeting to approve. The platform combines genuinely innovative safety features with practical workflow tools that sales teams actually need.

The Solo plan at $79/month gets you started with serious safety features that cost way more elsewhere. The Growth plan at $199/month for five sender profiles is legitimately competitive. And for agencies, the Flex plans offer unlimited teams and whitelabel capabilities at rates that make scaling profitable.

Is it perfect? No. The interface could be prettier, some features are still maturing, and you'll need to invest time learning the platform properly. But compared to the alternatives — expensive tools that get your accounts banned, or cheap tools that simply don't work — GetSales.io occupies a sweet spot.

The team behind it actually cares about the product (founder Peter is famously accessible), they ship improvements regularly, and they seem to understand that LinkedIn automation should reduce stress, not create it.

Six years of iteration shows. The product feels mature, tested, and built by people who've lived the pain they're solving. For agencies, IT service companies, and growing B2B teams, that's worth investigating.
